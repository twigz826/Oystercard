## Oystercard
This program was written as part of week 2 of the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp. The task was to create a program in ruby that emulates the oystercard system that was previously used in the London Underground transport system.

This repo was built using alternating pair programming following a TDD approach.
